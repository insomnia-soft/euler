    Counting Sundays
    Problem 19

    You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

        1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
        Thirty days has September,
        April, June and November.
        All the rest have thirty-one,
        Saving February alone,
        Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
        And on leap years, twenty-nine.
        A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.

    How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?
